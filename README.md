SIH 1653: Web based Selector-Applicant Simulation Software
## Problem Description
Background: Recruitment and Assessment Centre (RAC) under DRDO, Ministry of Defence carries out interviews for applications received against advertised vacancies and for promotion to next higher grade for scientific manpower inducted within DRDO. Description: The process of interviewing is a challenging task. An unbiased objective interviewing process helps identify the right talent. The basic process of an interview involves posing a set of questions by an interviewer and thereafter evaluating responses from candidates. Thus, the questions asked should be relevant and match the area/ expertise of the applicant and the responses should also be of relevance w.r.t. the question asked. Expected Solution: The proposed solution should provide experts as well as candidates a real life Board Room experience, starting with initial ice-breaking questions leading to in-depth techno-managerial (depending on the level of candidate) questions. It shall also be able to provide a quantifiable score for experts as well as the candidate for the relevancy of questions w.r.t. the area/ expertise of the applicant. Similarly, candidate responses should also be graded for relevancy w.r.t. the question asked, finally assisting in arriving at an overall score for the subject knowledge of the candidate and thus his/ her suitability against the advertised post.

## Idea

The **AI-powered Smart Interview Evaluation System** will revolutionize the **interview and assessment process** at the Recruitment and Assessment Centre (RAC), DRDO, by ensuring **objectivity, efficiency, and accuracy**. The system will function as a **virtual boardroom**, enabling experts to conduct structured interviews while minimizing biases. It will feature **AI-driven dynamic question generation**, which tailors questions based on the candidate's **technical domain, job role, and experience level**. The interview will follow a **structured progression**, beginning with **ice-breaking questions** before delving into **in-depth technical and managerial discussions**, depending on the seniority of the candidate. To ensure fairness, the system will also **evaluate the relevance of the questions posed by interviewers**, ensuring they align with the candidate’s expertise.  

The **core intelligence of the system** will be powered by **Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Learning (ML), and Knowledge Graphs** to analyze responses in real-time. Each answer will be graded based on **relevance, accuracy, depth of understanding, and clarity**. The system will assign **quantifiable scores** to both **interviewers and candidates**, ensuring an objective assessment. Additionally, **speech and sentiment analysis** will be integrated to assess the **confidence, communication skills, and logical reasoning** of candidates. A **final suitability score** will be computed, assisting experts in making **data-driven recruitment decisions**. This AI-driven approach will not only streamline the **scientific manpower selection process** within DRDO but also enhance **transparency, standardization, and efficiency** in assessing candidates for **both recruitment and promotions**.

To further enhance the interview experience, the system will incorporate **AI-powered analytics and reporting**, providing detailed insights into candidate performance. Each interview will be recorded, transcribed, and analyzed to generate a **comprehensive performance report**, highlighting strengths and areas of improvement. The system will also compare the candidate’s responses with a **benchmark database of expert answers**, ensuring a fair and objective evaluation. Additionally, **peer comparison analytics** will enable the board to assess how a candidate performs relative to others, helping in making well-informed selection decisions. This will be particularly useful in **high-stakes recruitment scenarios** where precise evaluation is critical.  

For seamless integration into DRDO’s recruitment framework, the system will support **both in-person and remote interviews**, ensuring accessibility for candidates from different locations. A **secure and encrypted digital platform** will safeguard sensitive candidate data and ensure compliance with **government recruitment policies**. Over time, the AI model will continue to **learn and improve**, refining its questioning strategies and assessment metrics based on past interview data. By implementing this **AI-powered Smart Interview Evaluation System**, RAC can modernize its recruitment process, making it **more efficient, data-driven, and transparent**, ultimately helping DRDO attract and retain the best scientific talent.
